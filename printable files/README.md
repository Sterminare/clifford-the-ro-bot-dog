# read this file before printing any parts to avoid confusion/extra parts/missing parts.

all parts should be printable without support
with the exception of 'leg > foot'.

some parts have threaded inserts that are not yet utilized and may never be utilized- they are for future expansion without having to
reprint some core parts. if you want to be frugal, you can omit some of these by checking the CAD to see which are actually utilized. I
reccomend just installing all of them, they are cheap and you may regret it later if they are utilized in a future update.

almost all parts use M3 brass threaded inserts for screw threads. these cannot be omitted without making major changes to the design. the purpose
is to facilitate repeated dissasembly/reassembly during the build process, because plastic threads may wear out and not support as much torque.
threaded inserts area often available in a 'short' and a 'long' variant for a given size, the parts are designed for the 'long' variant but the 'short' should work
too. but I would reccomend the longer ones for the stronger holding strength.

'chassis > top panel' has in-built supports. You should print this part upright with no additional supports, then clip off the thin supports before installing.
'leg > foot' is intended to be printed in soft TPU for grip, but many TPU are not particularly grippy despite their flexibility. This part will likely be replaced by
a cast silicone foot in the future, which ideally will be compatible with the current lower leg.

# I would recommend exporting and printing parts directly from the CAD instead of using these files. 

These files are liable to be not up-to-date, there could be
mistakes in the quantity/mirror denomination. Exporting and printing directly from the CAD ensures that you're printing the correct parts and also serves as
an instruction/assembly manual. If you don't have access to Fusion 360, and thus need to use these pre-exported files, please note:

parts are denoted by their name followed by the quantity that you should print as-is, and mirrored (in any direction).
quantity on parts in 'leg (2x + 2x mirror)' are quantity to print one leg- therefore, print the entire folder twice, and twice mirrored
as denoted by folder name.

parts are not always oriented in a good printing orientation. use best judgement, given that all parts should be printable without support
with the exception of 'leg > foot'.

if you notice a part is outdated, or an error in the denomination, please report it and I'll update it.
